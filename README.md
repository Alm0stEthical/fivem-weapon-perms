Extremely simple and easy to configure weapon restriction script using ace permissions to give you ease of mind regarding what weapons your players can and can't access.

Allows optional messages on a per weapon basis to give information to your players such as:<br>
`"Visit our store to gain access to this weapon!"`
- Requires `ox_Lib`

Drag and drop the `chroma-weaponperms` folder into your resources folder and add `start chroma-weaponperms` to your CFG.
Add weapons via the `config.lua` with your desired ace permissions.

To give someone an ace permission, you would do `add_ace group.donator weapon.marksmanrifle allow` as an example.
